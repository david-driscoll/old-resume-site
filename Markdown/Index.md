I'm a .NET and C# Developer living in Edmonton, Alberta with Upside Software, my current focus is core framework integration and user interface design and functionality.  On the framework integration side, my tasks include complex interactions in [MVC 2/3/4](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3), [Unity 2.0](http://unity.codeplex.com/) and [NHibernate](http://nhforge.org/Default.aspx).  On the JavaScript User Interface side have been centered around creating UI controls, extending the JavaScript functionality of the Telerik MVC suite of controls and creating integrated UI pages where a post back is the bane of all existence.


This site has been created with my custom built framework that was designed with the knowledge I gained while working with MVC 3, NHibernate and Unity.  This website instead of using Unity uses [Ninject](http://ninject.org/) as most sites that I plan this framework to work with aren’t designed around requiring complex xml based configuration, in code configuration is more than enough.


Feel free to look under my [Portfolio](~/Portfolio); I plan to keep that updated with new projects as they come along.


My [Resume](/Resume) is open to anyone that wants to take a look; it is available for viewing and downloadable in various formats.


I also have plans for a bunch of [Open Sourced Projects](/Projects) to be added, I have a few that have evolved after creating this site that may be useful for others.
