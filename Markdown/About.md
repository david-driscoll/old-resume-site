By day I'm a .NET and C# Developer with Upside Software.  Currently I’m on the framework team and my normal day to day tasks involve core framework integration and user interface design and functionality.  On the framework integration side, my tasks include complex interactions in [MVC 3](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3), [Unity 2.0](http://unity.codeplex.com/) and [NHibernate](http://nhforge.org/Default.aspx).  On the JavaScript User Interface side have been centered around creating UI controls, extending the JavaScript functionality of the Telerik MVC suite of controls and creating integrated UI pages where page load is the bane of all existence.


By night I’m a husband to my wonderful wife Tami and a father of my three amazing step daughters. We got married on June 25, 2011 in a subtle but beautiful wedding. When I’m not coding up a storm, or working more overtime than my wife would prefer, we enjoy camping in the summer with our girls to get away from the world and enjoy the good old outdoors.


In my spare time I focus on expanding my knowledge and trying to learn and implement the latest and greatest technologies that either makes my job easier or makes the user experience that much better.
